This sample shopping site is the last project of the book Pure React.

I solved the exercises, which added:
 - Nav item displaying cart total and number of items in cart
 - Total shown in the cart page
 - Empty cart message
 
To be added
  - Fetching the data from an API
  - other features of a marketplace like sign-in, checkout etc.
