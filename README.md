# ShoppingSite-PureReact
Created with CodeSandbox

This project can be viewed at [![Edit Shopping site - modified](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/1q51lwzrn4?view=preview)

This sample shopping site is the last project of the book Pure React.

I solved the exercises, which added:
 - Nav item displaying cart total and number of items in cart
 - Total shown in the cart page
 - Empty cart message
 
To be added
  - Fetching the data from an API
  - other features of a marketplace like sign-in, checkout etc.
